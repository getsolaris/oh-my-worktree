# oml CLI Smoke Testing

Use this skill to run exhaustive, real-command QA for `oh-my-lemontree` without touching the developer's real repo, shell config, or tmux state.

## Purpose

Treat `src/cli/index.ts` and `src/cli/cmd/*.ts` as the source of truth for the command surface. Build the execution plan from code first, then run commands in isolated temp environments and collect evidence for every command and every flag.

Keep `AGENTS.md` short. Put the long-form manual QA procedure here.

## Use This Skill When

- Full CLI smoke coverage is requested, not just one command.
- A change touched multiple CLI commands or shared core behavior.
- A release-ready verification pass is needed.
- A command appears broken only in certain repo/config/tmux states and isolation is required.
- Flag-level regression is needed after adding or changing options to any command.

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- Only one command needs a quick local check.
- The work is docs-only and no runtime behavior changed.
- A single focused regression test already proves the behavior and no wider smoke pass is requested.

## Core Rules

1. Read `src/cli/index.ts` and `src/cli/cmd/*.ts` before running anything.
2. Use temp directories for `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and any generated repos.
3. Use a unique tmux prefix or isolated tmux socket when testing `session` flows.
4. Never run destructive QA against the project repo.
5. Capture exact command, cwd, relevant env isolation, exit code, stdout, and stderr.
6. Distinguish fixture problems from product bugs by re-running suspicious failures in a cleaner fixture.
7. Every boolean flag must have at least one positive test. Every string/number flag must have one valid-value test and one invalid-value test. Every alias must be tested at least once.
8. Use `bun run src/index.ts` not `oml` for all dev-mode testing.

## Execution Workflow

### 1. Build the command manifest

Enumerate commands from the registry, then classify each as one of:

- config/init/shell setup
- read-only repo inspection
- worktree mutation
- remote/archive/import
- session/tmux
- TUI startup

Use `references/command-groups.md` as the current baseline, but trust the code over the reference if they diverge.

### 2. Build isolated fixtures

Create temp roots for:

- `HOME`
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
- seeded git repo
- optional bare remote
- disposable worktree directories
- tmux state

```bash
TMPROOT=$(mktemp -d)
export HOME="$TMPROOT/home"
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$TMPROOT/xdg"
mkdir -p "$HOME" "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
git init "$TMPROOT/repo"
cd "$TMPROOT/repo"
git config user.email "qa@test.local"
git config user.name "QA"
echo "seed" > seed.txt && git add seed.txt && git commit -m "init"
```

Use `references/manual-qa-playbook.md` for the full fixture layout and wave plan.

### 3. Run baseline repo validation

For non-doc-only work, run this order first:

1. `bun run typecheck`
2. targeted `bun test <file>` if a focused regression file exists
3. `bun test`
4. `bun run build`
5. `bun run src/index.ts` for TUI startup if TUI behavior changed or a broad smoke pass is requested

### 4. Run grouped command QA

Run commands in safe groups:

- config/init commands against temp `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
- read-only commands against a seeded temp repo
- destructive commands against disposable worktrees or repo copies
- remote commands against a temp bare remote
- session commands with isolated tmux state

Prefer real commands over synthetic assertions. Verify the side effects after each mutating command.

**Flag-level coverage requirements per group:**

- **Wave 3 (config/init/shell):** every flag for `config`, `init`, `shell-init` — including all aliases and negative cases for flags that require companion flags (`--activate` without `--profile`, etc.)
- **Wave 4 (read-only):** every flag for `list`, `status`, `doctor`, `diff`, `exec`, `log` — including all `-j`/`-a`/`-p` aliases
- **Wave 5 (mutation):** every flag for `add`, `remove`, `switch`, `rename`, `clean`, `pin`, `open`, `log --clear` — including dirty-worktree negative cases for `remove` without `--force`
- **Wave 6 (remote/archive/import):** every flag for `clone`, `import`, `archive` — including `--no-init-config`, `--keep`, `--pin`
- **Wave 7 (session):** every flag for `session` and `add --session` — including `--kill`, `--kill-all`, `--layout`

### 5. Record evidence

For each command, record:

```
COMMAND: bun run src/index.ts <args>
CWD: <path>
ENV: HOME=<tmp> XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<tmp> [TMUX_TMPDIR=<tmp>]
EXIT: <code>
STDOUT: <summary or first 5 lines>
STDERR: <summary or first 5 lines>
POST: <git worktree list / file existence / tmux ls>
RESULT: PASS | FAIL | SKIP (reason)
```

### 6. Check the flag coverage checklist

Before closing the smoke run, work through the flag coverage checklist in `references/manual-qa-playbook.md`. Every checkbox must be either PASS or SKIP with a documented reason (e.g., "requires gh CLI", "requires tmux").

### 7. Handle failures carefully

When a command fails:

1. Decide whether the fixture was invalid.
2. Re-run once in a simpler clean fixture if the failure might be environmental.
3. Treat repeatable failures in a valid fixture as real bugs.
4. Do not silently skip the command.

## Additional Resources

- `references/manual-qa-playbook.md` — fixture design, isolation rules, per-flag test cases organized by wave, and the flag coverage checklist
- `references/command-groups.md` — complete flag matrix for every command with exact flag names, types, aliases, and test invocations

## Output Expectations

End with a compact evidence report that covers:

- what was executed
- which commands passed (with flag variants noted)
- which commands failed
- which flags were skipped and why
- whether a failure was caused by the product or by an intentionally dirty fixture
- any commands that required special isolation
- the flag coverage checklist completion percentage
